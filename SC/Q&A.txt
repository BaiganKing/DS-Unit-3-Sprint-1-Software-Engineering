Question: What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews?
That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code,
and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

Answer: When I review code, I firstly look at the readability and formatting
of the code. Another very import thing to lookout for is how recreatable and
how easy it would be for a third-party to understand what is being done in the
code.

Question: We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty
confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How
could containers help us improve this situation?

Answer: Containers can resolve this issue by creating a virtual machine with
only the required packages to isolate the program you want to run preventing
any interferences from other things running on the system.
